# DuckDB Integration

The engine embeds DuckDB natively (requires the `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` JVM flag — see
[build & run](../build-run/build-test.md)).

* **Appender, not JDBC batch.** `DuckDbRecordSink` and `TypedRecordIngester` bulk-load via the DuckDB
  `DuckDBAppender` API (heap buffer `APPEND_BATCH = 10,000` rows). Benchmarked on 1M rows: JDBC
  `PreparedStatement.executeBatch` ≈ 6.9K rows/s vs the Appender ≈ 520–530K rows/s — **~75× faster**, at
  parity with the native CSV reader.
* **Thread auto-derivation.** `DuckDbUtil.effectiveWorkerThreads` (`inspecto-util/src/main/java/com/gamma/util/DuckDbUtil.java`)
  derives per-batch `duckdb_threads`: `0` (default) with batch concurrency > 1 → `max(1, cores/concurrency)`;
  explicit `N` honored verbatim; `-1` → DuckDB's per-core default. Avoids the threads×cores oversubscription
  stall; `ConfigValidator` warns when explicit `threads × duckdb_threads` exceeds the core count.
* **Memory / spill caps (opt-in; one knob for every scratch connection).** `DuckDbUtil.applyDuckDbSettings`
  sets `memory_limit` / `temp_directory` (spill) / `max_temp_directory_size` when a value is configured;
  unset ⇒ DuckDB's own default (≈ 80% RAM **per instance** — the aggregate-overcommit hazard under
  concurrency). The batch-ingest path caps its connections via `BatchIngestStrategy.configure`
  (per-pipeline `processing.duckdb.*`). The **flow-job** (`PipelineJobRunner`) and **enrichment**
  (`EnrichmentEngine`) run scratch connections have no per-config `processing.duckdb` section, so they call
  `DuckDbUtil.applyGlobalDuckDbSettings`, which reads the global JVM fallbacks
  `-Dprocessing.duckdb.memory_limit` / `.temp_directory` / `.max_temp_directory_size` / `.threads`; the
  batch path honors the same globals as a fallback (`DuckDbUtil.globalOr`), so a single
  `-Dprocessing.duckdb.memory_limit` caps every DuckDB scratch connection uniformly. **All opt-in** — with
  no config or `-D` value set nothing is issued and behavior is unchanged. Set these on high-concurrency /
  multi-tenant boxes to prevent overcommit, and pair with `temp_directory` so an over-limit query spills to
  disk instead of OOM-ing. (Preview / dry-run connections — `ComponentPreview`, `PipelineDryRun`, enrichment
  `preview` — run over bounded samples and are deliberately left uncapped.)
* **Reserved-word quoting.** `day` is a DuckDB keyword — alias it (`run_day`) in SQL; quote `"trigger"` too.
  Watch this whenever generating SQL with date/trigger columns. See [gotchas](../gotchas/cross-cutting.md).

Output is written via DuckDB `COPY` — see [output & sinks](output-sinks.md).
