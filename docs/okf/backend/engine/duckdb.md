# DuckDB Integration

The engine embeds DuckDB natively (requires the `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` JVM flag — see
[build & run](../build-run/build-test.md)).

* **Appender, not JDBC batch.** `DuckDbRecordSink` and `TypedRecordIngester` bulk-load via the DuckDB
  `DuckDBAppender` API (heap buffer `APPEND_BATCH = 10,000` rows). Benchmarked on 1M rows: JDBC
  `PreparedStatement.executeBatch` ≈ 6.9K rows/s vs the Appender ≈ 520–530K rows/s — **~75× faster**, at
  parity with the native CSV reader.
* **Thread auto-derivation.** `DuckDbUtil.effectiveWorkerThreads` (`inspecto/src/main/java/com/gamma/util/DuckDbUtil.java`)
  derives per-batch `duckdb_threads`: `0` (default) with batch concurrency > 1 → `max(1, cores/concurrency)`;
  explicit `N` honored verbatim; `-1` → DuckDB's per-core default. Avoids the threads×cores oversubscription
  stall; `ConfigValidator` warns when explicit `threads × duckdb_threads` exceeds the core count.
* **Reserved-word quoting.** `day` is a DuckDB keyword — alias it (`run_day`) in SQL; quote `"trigger"` too.
  Watch this whenever generating SQL with date/trigger columns. See [gotchas](../gotchas/cross-cutting.md).

Output is written via DuckDB `COPY` — see [output & sinks](output-sinks.md).
