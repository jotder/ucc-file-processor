# Reconciliation

Route `/reconciliation` (Business + Builder lenses). Vocabulary is locked
([`GLOSSARY.md`](../../../GLOSSARY.md) §7): a **Reconciliation** compares **Datasets** on key columns
with per-column tolerances; a **Break** is `missing_left | missing_right | value_break` with an
`open/resolved/auto_closed` lifecycle (auto-close on re-match within tolerance). Never a parallel
"comparison" concept.

* **Board** (`:id` default view) — the aggregate dimension-order tree on
  [`inspecto-tree-table`](../design-system/tree-table.md): unified dimension/measure selection, parents
  carry rollups, Δ% columns **banded** ok/warn/breach (defaults 1/2 %; independent of record-level
  tolerance). Δ% is **Anchor-relative** (`datasets[0]`; 0-anchor ⇒ exact).
* **Breaks page** — drill from a Board cell to the three live record sets (only-in-A / only-in-B /
  common-but-different) with path scoping; 3-way adds a **Presence Pattern** filter bar.
* **3-way** — N=3 anchor reconciliation shipped (DAT-7 P4); N>3, non-additive aggs, and fuzzy key
  matching are explicit non-goals for now.
* **Reusable** — a Reconciliation renders as a **Widget** and rides bundle export/template flows
  (DAT-7 P3); persisted as the `reconciliation` component kind with real backend routes
  `/recon/columns|run|breaks` (DAT-7 P0 — the query gate pattern from the Data Browser).
* Runs are manual in v1 (no auto-refresh); scheduled `recon.run` Jobs + Alert Rule → Incident wiring
  are designed-for follow-ups. Break-level assignment stays with Cases.
