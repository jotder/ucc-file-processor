# Link Analysis

The Builder-lens studio at `/studio/link-analysis` for graph investigation. Keep the four graph planes
distinct ([`GLOSSARY.md`](../../../GLOSSARY.md) §11): this studio works on **P3 — Entity/Link graphs**
(records as business entities), never on artifact/lineage graphs.

* **Sources** — a **GraphSource** feeds one renderer through one query seam; the P3 source is
  **Entity Projection**: a mapping (not a store) that folds a Dataset's rows into Entities + Links
  (column → source/target Entity, optional columns → Link type/attributes).
* **Rendering** — the shared G6 host (`src/app/inspecto/graph/`), reused by the Catalog graph and the
  Geo co-location bridge. Nodes are canvas-drawn — verify inspector logic in unit tests, not preview clicks.
* **Toolboxes** — Layout (11 G6 layouts; tree shapes gated to acyclic data) and Algorithm (Louvain
  community detection, graph pattern matching), plus paths/neighborhood/centrality analysis.
* **Saved investigations** — a **Link-Analysis View** (Component kind `link-analysis-view`) via the
  shared `inspecto/investigation` lib; when its source is `entity-projection` it is renderable as a
  **Widget** (a Graph Visualization Type bound to a Dataset).
* **Status** — UI shipped mock-first; the backend Entity Projection over real Datasets shipped
  (REQUIREMENTS INV-1, `POST /inv/projection`), including the full V1 slice (multi-mapping, multi-root,
  incremental expand, SVG/GraphML export, undo/redo, `attrCols` — the last is fully implemented both
  backend (`InvRoutes`) and UI (`entity-projection.ts`), not open despite an earlier stale note here).
  **2026-07-20 shipped the schema-relationship model**, §7's other deferred half: `GET
  /inv/schema/relationships` infers naming-convention FK suggestions across Datasets (`<base>_id` column
  → a Dataset named `<base>`, linked to its `id` column or a same-named column), so the Studio can
  pre-fill multi-mapping projections instead of requiring every column pair hand-picked. Self-references
  (e.g. `manager_id`) are included; unusable Datasets are skipped, not fatal. Only V2+ items remain open.
