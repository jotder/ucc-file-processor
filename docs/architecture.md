## Design Philosophy & Scope

> engine (`com.gamma.etl` + `com.gamma.inspector`). The platform has since grown a
> **Stage-2 enrichment engine** (`com.gamma.enrich`, shipped across the 2.x line) that
> deliberately *does* the joins and aggregation listed below as Stage-1 non-goals — on the
> Hive-partitioned Parquet output, orchestrated by the service/control plane. The non-goals
> below are **still correct for Stage-1** (they are what keep each batch embarrassingly
> parallel and crash-isolated); they are no longer platform-wide. The two-stage shape is
> mapped in [v3-architecture.md](v3-architecture.md); Stage-2's design is in
> [v2-plan.md](v2-plan.md). "Do it downstream" now has a first-class, in-platform answer.

This is a deliberately small ETL engine built around one idea: an **M..N
multiplexer**. A batch of **M** input files is demultiplexed and routed into
**N** partitioned output files — explicitly *not* one-to-one. Understanding this
framing explains every design choice that follows, and the non-goals are as
important as the goals.

### The M..N multiplexer

Records flow from many inputs to many outputs; the input file count and the
output file count are decoupled. Two complementary mechanisms do the routing:

- **Partition fan-out (the "N").** Every surviving record is routed to an output
  file by its partition key — typically `year/month/day` derived from a date
  column, optionally prefixed by other columns (e.g. `event_type`). A batch of
  M files spanning 30 days produces ~30 partition files per segment, regardless
  of how the input was split across files.
- **Segment demultiplexing (plugin path).** A single input file can carry
  multiple record types (e.g. CALL + SMS interleaved in one CDR file). The
  [plugin ingester](plugins.md#plugin-ingester) splits these into independent typed
  streams, each with its own schema and its own partitioned output tree. One
  input → many typed outputs.

Combined: **M input files → unioned per record type → N partitioned outputs.**
The batch is the unit of work; partition key and segment type are the routing
keys.

### Minor, per-record transformations only

Transformations are **stateless and applied to each record independently** —
the kind of work that maps cleanly onto DuckDB's vectorized SQL:

- Type coercion — VARCHAR → `DATE` / `TIMESTAMP` / `DOUBLE` / `INTEGER`
- Column selection and renaming (raw `selector` index → target column)
- Partition-key derivation (`YEAR()` / `MONTH()` / `DAY()` from a date)
- Lightweight composition — `CONCAT_DT` (date + time → timestamp),
  `FILENAME_DATE` (extract a date embedded in the filename)

That's the whole transformation vocabulary. It's intentionally narrow.

### Deliberate non-goals (Stage-1)

The **Stage-1 ingest engine does not** — by design, not by omission (Stage-2 enrichment
does these; see the scope note above):

- **Join against external / reference data.** No dimension lookups, no
  enrichment from a second source, no foreign-key resolution.
- **Aggregate across records.** No `GROUP BY` rollups, no windowing, no dedup
  across rows. (The only cross-record operation is the lineage count matrix,
  which is audit metadata, not output data.)
- **Hold state across records or batches.** Each record is transformed in
  isolation; each batch is independent.

### Why the non-goals matter

These constraints are what make the engine fast, parallel, and crash-isolated.
Because no batch needs shared reference state, every batch is an embarrassingly
parallel, single-pass unit with its own DuckDB connection (see
[Batch Processing](operations.md#batch-processing)). Adding joins or lookups would force
shared state, serialize the batch model, and break the clean M..N routing. If
you need heavy joins or enrichment, do it **downstream** — query the
Hive-partitioned Parquet output through the
[warehouse query layer](integrations.md#warehouse-query-layer--dbeaver-via-pg_duckdb) or a
DuckLake catalog, where a real SQL engine can join across the whole dataset. The
multiplexer's job ends at partition-and-write.

Since the 2.x line, that downstream answer is **first-class and in-platform**: the
**Stage-2 enrichment engine** (`com.gamma.enrich`) reads the Hive-partitioned output as
views and runs exactly these joins/aggregations as its own `transform` SQL, idempotently and
incrementally (event- or schedule-driven), under the same service/control plane. So "do it
downstream" no longer means "leave the platform" — Stage-1 stays a clean multiplexer, and
Stage-2 owns the cross-record work. See [v3-architecture.md](v3-architecture.md) for the
two-stage map.

### Format-specific configuration

Because different source formats need different handling, configuration is
organized **per format** rather than forced into one shape — and that
divergence is intended. Delimited text uses `csv_settings`; binary/proprietary
formats use a plugin `ingester` plus `ingester_config`. See
[Configuration by source format](configuration.md#configuration-by-source-format) for the map.

```

The **Pre ETL utilities** (`MainApp`) handle the movement and unpacking of raw deliveries into the inbox layout that `SourceProcessor` expects.

**SchemaExtractor** (`create-schema` command) is a one-time bootstrap tool — it reads a generation profile and a sample file and produces the schema and pipeline configs.

**SourceProcessor** is the runtime engine — it reads the generated configs, polls the inbox directory, and processes every file it finds.

    PartitionDef             — record + enum for explicit partitions[] declarations; backward-compat fromSchema()
  ingester/
    TypedRecordIngester      — reference FileIngester for type-tagged text records; multi-segment dispatch

    TarInboxPreparer         — toon-native alias for the extract workflow
    TarExtractor             — recursive walk for 'unknown/' tar archives; sentinel-based skip
    IntegratedProcessor      — extract + move for CBS CDR adjustment archives
    SchemaExtractor          — DuckDB-powered type inference; generates _schema.toon + _pipeline.toon
    MainApp                  — CLI dispatcher for all pre-ETL utility commands
    ParquetSummarizer        — count rows and bytes across a database/ Parquet tree
    PartitionSummarizer      — partition-level statistics for one or more tables
    FileMoverByDate          — date-partition files from a flat directory into year/month/day tree
```

**Design principle:** `SourceProcessor` is a pure orchestrator — it creates the thread pool and drives the per-batch lifecycle, but contains zero business logic itself.  Every concern is owned by a focused single-responsibility class: batch planning (`BatchPlanner`), parsing (`CsvIngester`), transformation (`DataTransformer`), deduplication (`MarkerManager`), quarantine (`QuarantineManager`), registration (`DuckLakeRegistrar`), and auditing (`BatchAuditWriter`, `ManifestStore`, `LineageCollector`).  All shared low-level helpers live in `com.gamma.util` and are reused by both the ETL and the pre-ETL utilities.

All `dirs.*` paths in pipeline configs are relative to the **sandbox root** (the JVM working directory).

## Two-Step Process

### Step 1 — Schema bootstrapping (run once)

```
create-schema  <source_name>  <sample_file.csv>  <gen_config.toon>
```

Reads the generation profile, auto-infers column types from the sample, and writes:
- `<source>_schema.toon` — field definitions and mapping rules (the ETL source of truth)
- `<source>_pipeline.toon` — runtime directories, threading, output format

These generated files are committed to version control and edited as needed. **SchemaExtractor is never involved in production processing.**

### Step 2 — ETL processing (continuous)

```
SourceProcessor  <pipeline_config.toon>
```

Reads both generated config files, polls the inbox directory, and for each unprocessed file:
1. Streams raw CSV lines into a per-worker DuckDB staging table
2. Applies typed SQL transformations via DuckDB
3. Writes partitioned output (Parquet or CSV)
4. Optionally registers output into DuckLake
5. Writes a `.processed` marker and updates the status log
